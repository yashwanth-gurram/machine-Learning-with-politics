## Model development
* Firstly, I split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 20%.
* Used a standard scaler to preprocess the data.
* Then I used three classifiers namely logistic regressor, Decision tree classifier and Random Forest classifier to predict.

## Model Performance

Model | Accuracy
------|---------
Logistic Regression | 90.5%
Decision Tree | 88%
Random Forest | 92%
